# PermuDictionary
<h4>Find out what other meaningful words your name (or whatever word) can make.</h4>
 
PermuDictionary is a python tool that finds out all the possible permutations of an input word and prints out the meaning of words found in the dictionary, presenting them in an elegant manner.

## Features:

<li><b>Speed</b>: Pyenchant is used first to filter out the words with meaning, then PyDictionary to fetch meaning.</li>
<li><b>Uniqueness</b>: no duplicates are allowed.</li>
<li><b>no_requirements.txt</b>: the program installs dependencies on its own, no manual work needed.</li>
<li><b>output options</b>: you can choose your output to be on the console or a .txt file.</li>
</ul>
