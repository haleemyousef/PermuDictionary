# Introduction:
permudictionary is a tool that finds out all the possible permutations of an input word and prints out the meaning of words found in the dictionary, presenting them in a delicate manner.

# Features:
  -Speed: Pyenchant is used first to filter out the words with meaning, then PyDictionary to fetch meaning.&nbsp;
  -Uniqueness: no duplicates are allowed.&nbsp;
  -no_requirements.txt: the program installs dependencies on its own, no manual work needed.&nbsp;
  -output options: you can choose your output to be on the console or a .txt file.&nbsp;
